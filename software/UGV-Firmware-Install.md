# UGV Firmware Install
Follow the [documentation](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ugv_jetson) on github.

> [!NOTE]
> After following the documentation we had an issue with the NumPy version. To fix the issue we added the ``numpy==1.26.5`` line in the ``requirements.txt`` provided in the git repo before running the ``setup.sh`` file.
