# UGV Sub-controller (ESP32) JSON Command Set
The microcontroller is capable of receiving a wide variety of commands, and in this document, we will introduce these commands. 

## Composition of JSON Commands
Taking the command ``{"T":1,"L":0.2,"R":0.2}`` sent in the previous chapter as an example, the ``T`` value in this JSON data represents the command type, while the ``L`` and ``R`` values represent the target linear velocities for the left and right wheels, respectively. The unit for linear velocity is by default meters per second (m/s). In summary, this command is a motion control command where the motion parameters are the target linear velocities for the left and right wheels. All subsequent JSON commands will include a ``T`` value to define the command type, but the specific command parameters will vary depending on the type of command.

## JSON Command Set
You can view the definitions of these commands in the ``json_cmd.h`` file of our open-source microcontroller routine, or add new sub-controller functionalities yourself. 

### Motion Control Commands
These commands are fundamental to the mobile robot and are used for motion-related control functions.
Each command below includes three parts: an example, a brief introduction, and a detailed description. 

#### CMD_SPEED_CTRL
```JSON
{"T":1,"L":0.5,"R":0.5}
```
Sets the target linear velocity for both wheels (velocity closed-loop control).
 > [!NOTE]
 > ``L`` and ``R`` represent the target linear velocities for the left and right wheels, respectively, in m/s. Negative values indicate reverse rotation and 0 means stop. The range of target linear velocities depends on the motors/reducers/wheel diameters used in the product, and the relevant calculation formulas can be found in the open-source microcontroller routine. It's important to note that for chassis using brushed DC motors, when the given target velocity's absolute value is very small (but not 0), the motor's poor low-speed performance may cause significant speed fluctuations during movement.

#### CMD_PWM_INPUT
```JSON
{"T":11,"L":164,"R":164}
```
Sets the PWM value for both drive wheels (velocity open-loop control).
> [!NOTE]
> ``L`` and ``R`` represent the PWM values for the left and right wheels, respectively, with a range of ``-255`` to ``255``. Negative values indicate the reverse direction and an absolute value of ``255`` means 100% PWM, indicating full power operation for that wheel.

#### CMD_ROS_CTRL

```JSON
{"T":13,"X":0.1,"Z":0.3}
```
ROS control (velocity closed-loop control).
 > [!NOTE]
 > This command is for ROS-based host computer control of the chassis movement. ``X`` represents the linear velocity in m/s, which can be negative; ``Z`` represents the angular velocity in rad/s, which can also be negative.

#### CMD_SET_MOTOR_PID

```JSON
{"T":2,"P":20,"I":2000,"D":0,"L":255}
```
PID controller settings.
 > [!NOTE]
 > This command is used to tune the PID controller. The PID parameters in the example above are the default parameters for this product. ``L`` represents ``WINDUP_LIMITS``, which is an interface currently not used in the product.

### OLED Display Control Commands

The product comes with an OLED display, which communicates with the ESP32 module of the microcontroller via I2C. The host computer can send JSON commands to change the content displayed on the screen.

#### CMD_OLED_CTRL

```JSON
{"T":3,"lineNum":0,"Text":"putYourTextHere"}
```
Controls the display of custom content on the screen.
 > [!NOTE]
 > ``lineNum`` is the line number. A single JSON command can change the content of one line. Upon receiving a new command, the default OLED screen that appears at startup will disappear, replaced by your added content. For most products using a ``0``.91-inch OLED display, ``lineNum`` can be ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, or ``3``, totaling four lines. Text is the content you want to display on this line. If the content is too long for one line, it will automatically wrap to the next line, but this may also push off the last line of content.

#### CMD_OLED_DEFAULT

```JSON
{"T":-3}
```
Controls the display to show the default startup screen.
 > [!NOTE]
 > Use this command to revert the OLED display to the default image shown at startup.

### Module Type

The mobile chassis can be equipped with different types of modules (none/mechanical arm/gimbal). This command tells the microcontroller about the currently installed module type. This command is usually sent automatically by the host computer to the microcontroller at startup, and more details will be provided in later chapters.

#### CMD_MODULE_TYPE

```JSON
{"T":4,"cmd":0}
```
Sets the module type.
 > [!NOTE]
 > The ``cmd`` value represents the type of module. Currently, there are three options: ``0`` for no module, ``1`` for a robotic arm, and ``2`` for the pan-tilt.

### IMU Related Functions

The chassis is equipped with an IMU sensor. You can use the following commands to obtain data from the IMU sensor. It's important to note that after the product is powered on, the continuous feedback function for chassis information (including IMU data) is enabled by default. The IMU-related functions are only necessary when the continuous feedback function is disabled.

#### CMD_GET_IMU_DATA

```JSON
{"T":126}
```
Retrieves IMU data.
 > [!NOTE]
 > This command allows retrieval of data from the IMU sensor upon sending.

#### CMD_CALI_IMU_STEP

```JSON
{"T":127}
```
IMU calibration (reserved interface).
 > [!NOTE]
 > Current product programs do not require calibration; this command is a reserved interface for future use.

#### CMD_GET_IMU_OFFSET

```JSON
{"T":128}
```
Retrieves current IMU offsets (reserved interface).
 > [!NOTE]
 > This command can provide feedback on the offset values for each axis of the current IMU.

#### CMD_SET_IMU_OFFSET

```JSON
{"T":129,"x":-12,"y":0,"z":0}
```
Sets the IMU offsets (reserved interface).
 > [!NOTE]
 > This command allows setting the offset values for each axis of the IMU. It is a reserved command and not required for current products.

### Chassis Information Feedback
#### CMD_BASE_FEEDBACK

```JSON
{"T":130}
```
Chassis information feedback.
 > [!NOTE]
 > After the product is powered on, chassis information feedback is typically enabled by default and occurs automatically. If the continuous feedback function for chassis information is disabled, and there's a need to obtain information about the chassis at a single instance, this command can be used to acquire basic chassis data.

#### CMD_BASE_FEEDBACK_FLOW

```JSON
{"T":131,"cmd":1}
```
Continuous chassis information feedback.
 > [!NOTE]
 > Setting the cmd value to ``1`` enables this function, which is by default activated and continuously provides chassis information. Setting the cmd value to ``0`` disables this function. Once disabled, the host computer can use the ``CMD_BASE_FEEDBACK`` command to obtain chassis information.

#### CMD_FEEDBACK_FLOW_INTERVAL

```JSON
{"T":142,"cmd":0}
```
Sets the interval for continuous feedback.
 > [!NOTE]
 > The ``cmd`` value is the interval time to be set, in milliseconds (ms). This command allows adjusting the frequency of chassis feedback information.

#### CMD_UART_ECHO_MODE

```JSON
{"T":143,"cmd":0}
```
Sets the command echo mode.
 > [!NOTE]
 > When the ``cmd`` value is set to ``0``, echo is disabled. When the ``cmd`` value is set to ``1``, echo is enabled, which means the sub-controller will output the commands it receives, facilitating debugging and verification processes.

    - ``2``: for SHOULDER_JOINT
    - ``3``: for ELBOW_JOINT
    - ``4``: for EOAT_JOINT (wrist/claw joint)
- ``rad``: Angle to rotate to (in radians), based on the initial position of each joint. Default angles and rotation directions for each joint are provided.
    - The initial position default angle for ``BASE_JOINT`` is ``0``, with a rotation range of ``-3.14`` to ``3.14``. When the angle increases, the base joint rotates to the left; when the angle decreases, the base joint rotates to the right.
    - The initial position default angle for ``SHOULDER_JOINT`` is ``0``, with a rotation range of ``-1.57`` to ``1.57``. When the angle increases, the shoulder joint rotates forward; when the angle decreases, the shoulder joint rotates backward.
    - The initial position default angle for ``ELBOW_JOINT`` is ``1.570796``, with a rotation range of ``-1.11`` to ``3.14``. When the angle increases, the elbow joint rotates downward; when the angle decreases, the elbow joint rotates in the opposite direction.
    - The initial position default angle for EOAT_JOINT is ``3.141593``. For the default gripper joint, the rotation range is ``1.08`` to ``3.14``, and when the angle decreases, the gripper joint opens. If changed to a wrist joint, the rotation range is ``1.08`` to ``5.20``, and when the angle increases, the wrist joint rotates downward; when the angle decreases, the wrist joint rotates upward.
- ``spd``: Rotation speed in steps per second, with one full rotation equaling ``4096`` steps. A higher value indicates faster rotation; a value of ``0`` rotates at maximum speed.
- ``acc``: Acceleration at the start and end of the rotation, smoother with lower values, ranging from ``0-254`` in units of ``100`` steps/sec². An acc value of ``0`` signifies maximum acceleration.

#### CMD_JOINTS_RAD_CTRL

 - ``shoulder``: The angle of the shoulder joint.
 - ``elbow``: The angle of the elbow joint.
 - ``hand``: The angle of the gripper/wrist joint.
 - ``spd``: The speed of rotation, measured in steps per second. A servo motor completes one full rotation in ``4096`` steps. A higher numerical value corresponds to a faster speed. When the speed value is ```0```, rotation occurs at maximum speed.
 - ``acc``: The acceleration at the start and end of rotation. A smaller value results in smoother acceleration and deceleration. The value can range from ``0`` to ``254``, measured in ``100`` steps per second squared. For example, setting it to ``10`` would mean acceleration and deceleration occur at ``1000`` steps per second squared. When the acceleration value is ``0``, the maximum acceleration is used.
